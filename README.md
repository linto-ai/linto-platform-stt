# Linto-Platform-Stt-Standalone-Worker

This service is mandatory in a LinTO platform stack as the main worker for speech to text toolkit.

Generally, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is the task of recognition and translation of spoken language into text. Our ASR system takes advantages from the recent advances in machine learning technologies and in particular deep learning ones (TDNN, LSTM, attentation-based architecture). The core of our system consists of two main components: an acoustic model and a decoding graph. A high-performance ASR system relies on an accurate acoustic model as well as a perfect decoding graph.

## Usage
See documentation : [doc.linto.ai](https://doc.linto.ai/#/services/linstt)

# Deploy

With our proposed stack [linto-platform-stack](https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-stack)

# Develop

## Installation

### Packaged in Docker
To start the LinSTT service on your local machine or your cloud, you need first to download the source code and set the environment file, as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linto-ai/linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker
cd linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker
mv .envdefault .env
```

Then, to build the docker image, execute:

```bash
docker build -t lintoai/linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker .
```

Or by docker-compose, by using:
```bash
docker-compose build
```


Or, download the pre-built image from docker-hub:

```bash
docker pull lintoai/linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker:latest
```

NOTE: You must install docker on your machine.

## Configuration
The LinSTT service that will be set-up here require KALDI models, the acoustic model and the decoding graph. Indeed, these models are not included in the repository; you must download them in order to run LinSTT. You can use our pre-trained models from here: [linstt download](services/linstt_download).

###Â Outside LinTO-Platform-STT-Service-Manager

If you want to use our service alone without LinTO-Platform-STT-Service-Manager, you must `unzip` the files and put the extracted ones in the [shared storage](https://doc.linto.ai/#/infra?id=shared-storage). For example,

1- Download the French acoustic model and the small decoding graph

```bash
wget https://dl.linto.ai/downloads/model-distribution/acoustic-models/fr-FR/linSTT_AM_fr-FR_v1.0.0.zip
wget https://dl.linto.ai/downloads/model-distribution/decoding-graphs/LVCSR/fr-FR/decoding_graph_fr-FR_Small_v1.0.0.zip
```

2- Uncompress both files

```bash
unzip linSTT_AM_fr-FR_v1.0.0.zip -d AM_fr-FR
unzip decoding_graph_fr-FR_Small_v1.0.0.zip -d DG_fr-FR_Small
```

3- Move the uncompressed files into the shared storage directory

```bash
mv AM_fr-FR ~/linto_shared/data
mv DG_fr-FR_Small ~/linto_shared/data
```

4- Rename the default environment file `.envdefault` included in the repository `linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker` and configure it by providing the full path of the following parameters:

    AM_PATH=/full/path/to/linto_shared/data/AM_fr-FR
    LM_PATH=/full/path/to/linto_shared/data/DG_fr-FR_Small

5- If you want to use Swagger interface, you need to set the corresponding environment parameter:
    SWAGGER_PATH=/full/path/to/swagger/file

NOTE: if you want to use the user interface of the service, you need also to configure the swagger file `document/swagger.yml` included in the repository `linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker`. Specifically, in the section `host`, specify the address of the machine in which the service is deployed.

### Using LinTO-Platform-STT-Service-Manager
In case you want to use `LinTO-Platform-STT-Service-Manager`, you need to:

1- Create an acoustic model and upload the approriate file

2- Create a language model and upload the corresponding decoding graph

3- Configure the environment file of this service.

For more details, see instructions in [LinTO - STT-Manager](https://doc.linto.ai/#/services/stt_manager)

## Execute
In order to run the service alone, you have only to execute:

```bash
cd linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker
docker-compose up
```
Then you can acces it on [localhost:8888](localhost:8888)

To run and manager LinSTT under `LinTO-Platform-STT-Service-Manager` service, you need to create a service first and then to start it. See [LinTO - STT-Manager](https://doc.linto.ai/#/services/stt_manager_how2use?id=how-to-use-it)

Our service requires an audio file in `Waveform format`. It should has the following parameters:

    - sample rate: 16000 Hz
    - number of bits per sample: 16 bits
    - number of channels: 1 channel
    - microphone: any type
    - duration: <30 minutes

Other formats are also supported: mp3, aiff, flac, and ogg.

### Run Example Applications
To run an automated test go to the test folder

```bash
cd linto-platform-stt-standalone-worker/test
```

And run the test script:

```bash
./test_deployment.sh
```

Or use swagger interface to perform your personal test: localhost:8888/api-doc/
